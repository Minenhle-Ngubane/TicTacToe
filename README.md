# Tic Tac Toe in Python (OOP)

In the game of TicTacToe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) two players take turns to place X’s and 0’s on a board of 9 squares (3 squares across by 3 down). The first player to complete a sequence of three 0’s or X’sin either a row, column or on either diagonal becomes the winner. If all 9 squares are filled and there is no winner, the games ends in a draw.

The program prompts two players to enter an X token and an O token alternately. Whenever a token is entered, the program redisplays the board on the console and determines the status of the game (win, draw, or continue). 

## Here is a sample run:

[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ]

Enter a row ( 1, 2, or 3 ) for player X: 2
Enter a column ( 1, 2, or 3 ) for player X: 2

[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [X] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ]

Enter a row ( 1, 2, or 3 ) for player O: 2
Enter a column ( 1, 2, or 3 ) for player O: 3

[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [X] [O]
[ ] [ ] [ ]

Enter a row ( 1, 2, or 3 ) for player X: 3
Enter a column ( 1, 2, or 3 ) for player X: 3

[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [X] [O]
[ ] [ ] [X]

. . .

[X] [ ] [ ]
[O] [X] [O]
[ ] [ ] [X]

Game Over : X Player wins .
